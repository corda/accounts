/**
 * The [AccountService] provides an API for CorDapp developers to interact with accounts. An account makes no
 * assumptions about identity - instead, it is just a vault partition. Vault partitions are achieved by firstly
 * allocating UUIDs to [PublicKey]s (this is done via the [KeyManagementService] when a new key pair is created), then
 * secondly, when a state is stored in the vault using a [PublicKey] which is already mapped to a [UUID], the state can
 * be associated with the account identified by the mapped [UUID]. So, accounts are collections of [PublicKey]s mapped
 * to [UUID]s as well as the [ContractState]s participated in by those [PublicKey]s. Corda nodes act as account "hosts",
 * so we can say that an account is "hosted" by a particular [Party]. An account can only be hosted by one node at a
 * time. The [PublicKey]s used by accounts are randomly generated keys with no certificate path linking them to the host
 * node's legal identity. This means that only [AnonymousParty]s can be used to represent account keys. This also means
 * that there is no concept of identity for accounts at the network infrastructure level. Instead, CorDapp developers
 * must add their own identity layer for accounts. Account [UUID]s are unique at the network level where as account
 * names are unique at the node level. Also, the pair of account host and account name is unique at the network level.
 * Accounts are represented by a [ContractState] called [AccountInfo] - it contains the account name, account ID and
 * host. It may contain further information with future versions of the accounts module.
 *
 * The [AccountService] currently supports the following features:
 *
 * 1. Creating accounts with a specified name. [UUID]s are allocated randomly.
 * 2. Returning all accounts, our own accounts or accounts for a specific host.
 * 3. Returning all keys for a specified account ID.
 * 4. Returning the account ID associated with a specified [PublicKey].
 * 5. Returning the [AccountInfo] associated with a specified [PublicKey], account name or account ID.
 * 6. Sharing an [AccountInfo] with another [Party].
 * 7. Sharding a [StateAndRef] with another [Party] and synchronizing the [AccountInfo]s and [PublicKey]s associated
 *    with that state.
